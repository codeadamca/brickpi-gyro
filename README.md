# Dexter BrickPi and the Gyro Sensor

A Python snippet utilizing the LEGO EV3 gyroscopic sensor, the Dexter BrickPi and [BrickPi3](https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3). [BrickPi3](https://github.com/DexterInd/BrickPi3) is the Dexter recommended method of using the BrickPi with Python. 

This example displays the angles detected by the gyroscopic sensor in the terminal. 

This example requires the [Remote Development](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) VS Code extension to be installed.

Note: The ```main.py``` file may need to be started twice. The Gyro Sensor seems to fail every second execution.
